                <p>Never in all their history have men been able truly to conceive of the world as one: a single sphere,
                    a globe, having the qualities of a globe, a round earth in which all the directions eventually meet,
                    in which there is no center because every point, or none, is center — an equal earth which all men
                    occupy as equals. The airman's earth, if free men make it, will be truly round: a globe in practice,
                    not in theory.</p>

                <p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size
                    of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so
                    fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing
                    this has to change a man.</p>

                    to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man
                    has gone before.</p>
